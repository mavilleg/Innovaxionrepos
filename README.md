-  The objective of this workshop is to practice realistic AI orchestration scenarios and to learn how to build intelligent apps. At the end of the workshop you will:
Know how to use prompt engineering techniques for effective generative AI responses on OpenAI
Understand the implications of the usage of tokens and embeddings when interacting with an LLM
Have experience in leveraging AI orchestrators like Langchain/ Semantic Kernel with Azure OpenAI
Have evaluated different vector stores like Qdrant or Azure AI Search to enhance LLM responses with your data and context
Know how to turn a business scenario with data, context and user input into an intelligent application on Azure
